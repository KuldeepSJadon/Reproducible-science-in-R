Although advnaced tools like git and RMarkdown greatly enhance reporducibility, they are only useful if files and folders are organized in such a way that another person (or you 3 years later) can make sense of them.
This can be suprisingly difficult and there is no universal solution that will work best for all people or projects.
However, there are some tips that will help you arive at a solution that fits your work style and the needs of your project.

## File/Folder naming

Good file/folder naming is perhaps the easiest way to imporve the understandablilty of the digital aspects of your project.
Ideally, a file's name and the names of the folders it is in should be enough information to make a good guess at its contents.
Note that this information need not all be in the file's name, which would lead to unreadably long file names; it should be distributed throughout the names of the folders it is in as well as the file's name.
Below are a couple tips on file naming:

* Never use arbitry names (e.g. "Document1.Rmd", "asdafsa.Rmd"). If the file is unimportnat or temporary, name it something like "temp.Rmd", "scratch.Rmd", or "random_gibberish.Rmd" so that you dont need to open it to know that it is unimportant.
* Only use letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes in file names. 
    + Use underscores instead of spaces; file names with spaces are irritating to manipulate on the command line and are not well handled by unix-based operating systems.  
    + One or more dashes make good delimiters if a file's name has multiple distinct components (e.g. "chapter_1--what_i_did_today.Rmd").
* Avoid a mixture of upper and lower case letters. Unix-based operating systems are case-sensitive, so "file.Rmd" and "File.Rmd" would be considered differnent files yet they might be easily confused by people. If you use uppercase, use it for the whole file name (e.g. "README.txt").
* If a file/folder pertains to a specific date, perfix the date in the YYYY_MM_DD format (e.g. "2016_03_23--wheat_audpc.Rmd"). Using YYYY_MM_DD instead of something like YYYY_DD_MM means that files are sorted by date correclty by default. Also, YYYY_MM_DD is the [ISO standard format for dates](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso8601.htm).
* If multiple files/folders have a logical order, prefix them with numbers, padding with leading zeros when needed (e.g. "002--dna_extraction.Rmd"). The leading zeros make them ordered correctly by default.
* Use logical extensions for text files.
    + If a text file has a table of comma-separated values, use ".csv" instead of ".txt"; if it is tab-seperated, used ".tsv". 
    + If a text file contains markdown, use ".md".

## Folder structure 

How to best construct a logical hierarchy of folders is less well defined than nameing conventions since it will vary widly with project type and personal preference. 
Spend some time thinking about a system that will work for you and stick to it, at least within a single project.

* Dont heistate to use subfolders to group similar files. A deep hierarchy with simple file names is better than a shallow hiearchy with long names.
* Avoid large numbers of unrealted files/folders in a single folder. It should be easy to scan over file names to get a sense of what is in a folder. 
* Add a "README.md" file to folders explaining thier purpose and contents, especially if there are many files or file with unintuitive names. 
* Avoid using defualt, operating-system-specic directories like "My Documents" since these often get cluttered by program-generated files and have properties that are not supported by other operating systems. Instead, make a single directory that contains all of your files, not including programs and operating system components. This makes it easy to backup your files and transfer them to other computers. 


## Working habits

Good organiation takes time and work to create and maintain, but developing good habits can make task less daunting. 

* Maintain a consistent organization style on all of the computers you work on.
* Have a temporary folder for files that you might not keep or have not decided where to put yet. However, this must be kept clean to be useful.
* Use shorcuts/links to access commonly used files/folders, especially if your project calls for a deep folder hierachy.
* Make rutoine backups stored in three different ways (e.g. An external hardrive stored at home, an online backup service, and code and text on GitHub).
