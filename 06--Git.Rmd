# Introduction to Git



## What is git?

In technical terms, [git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control
system that is often used to keep track of software development. In not so
technical terms, it is a personal archivist/time machine that keeps track of all
the changes you make in a (writing or data analysis) project. Normally, when you
save progress on an analysis, the old version of that analysis is
lost. With git, as you make your steps toward completion of the analysis, you continue to save your progress, but you also tell git to remember what your analysis looks like at a certain time by 'committing' to all the changes that have happened. 





"save a version"

## Why should I use git?

Git allows you to not only save your work, but to save different versions of your work through time. Imagine that you were working on writing up an analysis, but wanted to save a version of your work at the end of the day every day so that you could go back to it at any time. You would likely have a series of files that looks like this at the end of three days:

```
analysis_one_2016-05-25.Rmd
analysis_one_2016-05-26.Rmd
analysis_one_2016-05-27.Rmd
```

After three days, it's manageable, but after 20 days, it's difficult to remember what you did between day 6 and day 7. With git, you only need one file:

```
analysis_one.Rmd
```

- because [You want to be able to recover your files quickly if they are accidentally deleted](https://elizabethwickes.com/2016/05/10/how-i-use-github-in-500-words/)
- because you want a way to remember your thought process coming up with an analysis
- because you wrote something that makes no sense and just want to go back to a previous version of the project without having to manually delete everything.
